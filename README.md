## Description

This app uses the 'Movie of the night' and 'tmdb' API, along with our own RESTful API, to combine all the available movies available to a user, based on the streaming providers they are subscribed to.

Users can create watch party's where they are able to add friends, expanding the available movies they can watch by pooling together streaming service providers. These groups also show movies liked by all users, to provide a quick suggestion as to what to watch.
